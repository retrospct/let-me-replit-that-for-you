# Let Me Replit That For You

A humorous web application that generates shareable demonstration links for Replit's AI assistant - similar to "Let Me Google That For You" but for Replit's platform. The app creates ephemeral URLs that show users how to interact with Replit's AI through animated demonstrations.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Ephemeral Operation** - No data storage, completely privacy-focused
- ðŸŽ¨ **Authentic Replit Branding** - Uses official Replit colors and styling
- âœ¨ **Smooth Animations** - Powered by Framer Motion for engaging user experience
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly across all devices
- ðŸš€ **Fast Performance** - Optimized React application with minimal dependencies
- ðŸ”— **Shareable Links** - Generate instant demonstration URLs
- ðŸŽ­ **Interactive Demo** - Animated typewriter effect and realistic UI simulation

## How It Works

1. Enter a prompt or question you want to demonstrate
2. Click "Generate Link" or press Enter
3. Share the generated URL with others
4. When visited, the link shows an animated demonstration of asking Replit's AI
5. The demo concludes with a redirect to the actual Replit AI interface
